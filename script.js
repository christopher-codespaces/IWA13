// changes 
// In the logCalc function, corrected the syntax errors and properly incremented the calculated variable.
// In the calcUser function, added curly braces to properly group the conditional statements.
// In the checkUser function, added a call to logCalc to ensure that calculated gets updated before checking the user.
